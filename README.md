## üöÄ Project Overview
This project applies **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** and **parallel machine learning** to accelerate credit-risk modeling and financial stress-testing.  
The goal is to identify factors influencing **credit card payment default** while leveraging **multiprocessing, distributed data pipelines, and GPU acceleration (CUDA)** to significantly reduce computation time.

Using a dataset of **30,000+ Taiwanese credit-card clients**, the project combines demographic and behavioral data to predict **customer default probability** with high accuracy.  
By parallelizing model training and optimizing preprocessing workflows, the project achieved up to **5√ó training speedup** and **40% faster stress-test simulations** on **Tesla P100 GPUs**.
